Intelligent Cleaner
-----
This project was created for Artificial Intelligence course.
The purpouse of this project was to implement machine learning algorithms,
so that the agent moves on its own and makes decisions on its own.

Information
-----
Applied algorithms:
- Genetic algorithm - to find optimal path
- Decision tree - to check if cleaner is able to clean dirt
- Neural network - to recognize dirt by image

Requirements
-----
Used libraries:
- pygame 1.9.2
- numpy 1.11.0
- pybrain 0.3
- cv2 1.0

Project was developed using Python 2.7.11


Dependencies (Linux)
-----

1) To start this project, first create virtualenv using python2. You need to have virtualenv module installed. Example command:

```
python2 -m virtual venv
```

2) To activate your local environment use this command:

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

After this "(venv)" should appear on the left of the prompt.

3) Now you can install all the requiremenets for the project. This should work:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the project
-----

To run the project do as follows:

1) Activate your local environment (if it is not activated already):

```
source venv/bin/activate
```

2) Simply run the main file from "src" directory:

```
main.py
```
